download_uniprot_lacertidae_db
    Download all lacertidae proteins from UniProtKB
fasterq_dump
    Download pre-fetched RNAseq libraries used for structural gene annotation
fixEC_incrementCDS_addLocusTags
    Remap Hypothetical Proteins based on fully-resolved EC Numbers. Delete EC Number of not fully-resolved.
    Increment CDS IDs so they're unique.
fix_seq
    Fix ID column where scaffold 0 was converted to SEQ
funannotate_annotate
    Use Funannotate to combine InterProScan and Eggnog annotations and generate additional functional annotations
funannotate_setup
    Download Databases for Funannotate
functional_stats
    Generate summary statistics of functional annotation using AGAT
get_proteins
    Get protein FASTA file using gffread
get_proteins_finalGFF
    Get final protein set using GFFREAD
gff_sort
    Sort GFF3 using genome tools
gff_sort_functional
    Sort GFF3 with functional annotations using GFF3_sort Perl script. Can't use genometools here since sorting not compatible with table2asn
gtf_to_gff
    Convert BRAKER-generated GTF to GFF3 using AGAT
gzip_fastq
    Gzip downloaded RNAseq libraries
merge_repeat_databases
    Merge de novo repeat library with Green Plant (i.e., Viridiplantae) repeat library from RepBase

    Merges STAR-aligned RNAseq reads into a single BAM file. This will be used as input to BRAKER in RNAseq-mode
prefetch
    Pre-fetch RNAseq libraries that will be used for structural gene annotation
qc_done
quast_psic_ref
    Run QUAST to generate genome assembly statistics
reformat_gff
    Fix transcript IDs for genes with alternative mRNA isoforms and remove transcript_id from gene features
remove_features
    Remove features except CDS. Required since BRAKER-generated GTFs are not compatible with most downstream software out-of-the box
remove_internalStop_gene
    Remove single gene with internal stop codong causing InterproScan to break
rename_tsebra_gtf
    Rename genes in combined TSEBRA GTF
repeat_masker
